Hey there and thanks for checking out my script! I hope you can find
many uses for it and will enjoy it as much as me and my cities have! we 
use MF_Inventory before but have made the move to OX_Inventory! 

**REQUIREMENTS**
~ Ox_libs
~ Ox_target
~ ESX Legacy 1.9.2+ or QBCore (uses Exports)

**MENU OPTIONS**
~ Chief can access any inventory that has been created so long as they 
know they name or case number for the locker/evidence storage! 
~ Lower rank officers can use this to store personal goods on them
or if they go off duty they can leave their weapons in a safe place! 
~ Deletion is in there but will not work at this time until i figure a 
smooth way to delete they inventories! if you have ideas PLEASE let me know!
~ You can use multiple locations with job based menus and rank 
based chief menus!
~ Each case has a unique id that can be pulled up from anywhere really!


**UTILIZATION**
~ Uses OX_libs for context and Dialog
~ Uses OX_Inventory for storage/lockers
~ Webhooks for Creating and Deleting Inventories!
